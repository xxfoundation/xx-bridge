### Project Structure

```plaintext
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ @types/           # TypeScript definitions and type augmentations.
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           # Static assets like images, logos, and icons, organized by category.
â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Modular and reusable UI components (e.g., Navbar, Footer, Modals).
â”œâ”€â”€ consts.ts         # Application-wide constants.
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/        # Blockchain smart contract interfaces and utilities for interactions.
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/            # Custom React hooks for shared logic (e.g., storage, wallet, and utilities).
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/            # Page components representing application routes (e.g., Bridge, ConnectPage).
â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/          # Configuration and setup for external libraries (e.g., Apollo, Redux, Substrate).
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/            # General-purpose utility functions (e.g., deepFreeze, promise handling).
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx           # Root React component.
â”œâ”€â”€ AppRouter.tsx     # Application routing logic.
â”œâ”€â”€ theme.ts          # Configuration for the Material-UI theme or other UI frameworks.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx          # Entry point for the React application.
```

### Environment Variables

Defined in the `netlify.toml` file and organized by context (e.g., branch-specific settings).

Environment variables are also listed in the `.env-example` file. Copy and paste them into a `.env` file, adjusting the values according to the desired context.

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky to enforce code quality:

- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality.
- **Prettier**: Maintains consistent code formatting.

These hooks run automatically before committing.

### Blockchain Details

- **Supported Chains**:
  - Ethereum (Mainnet, Testnets)
  - xx Network (Mainnet, Testnets)
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contract addresses for development are documented in `src/contracts/`.

### Build Process

The project uses Vite for builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build artifacts are output to the `dist/` folder.
